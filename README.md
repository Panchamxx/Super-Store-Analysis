# Superstore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Superstore sales dataset** to uncover sales trends, top-performing products, and customer insights. It demonstrates an **end-to-end data analysis workflow**, including **data cleaning in Excel and SQL, data validation, SQL queries, and dashboard visualization in Power BI**.

---

## Data
- **Sample - Superstore.csv**: Original Kaggle Superstore dataset.
  - Imported into Excel and SQL for cleaning and analysis.
  - All data cleaning (duplicates, missing values, column standardization) is performed in both **Excel and SQL**.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Excel Data Cleaning
- Removed blanks and duplicates.
- Corrected text case (Proper, Upper, Lower) and trimmed extra spaces.
- Used **Flash Fill** and **Text to Columns** for formatting.
- Applied **VLOOKUP** for cross-referencing customer and product information.
- Created **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts** for quick analysis and summary insights.
- Exported cleaned data to CSV for SQL import.

### 2. Clean Final Table (SQL)
- Created a clean table (`Superstore_Final`) in SQL.
- Removed duplicates, standardized column names, and handled missing values.

### 3. Insert Clean Data
- Loaded clean data into the clean SQL table.

### 4. Data Quality Checks
- Validated row counts, checked for nulls and duplicates.
- Ensured data consistency and integrity before analysis.

### 5. Analysis Queries
- Generated insights such as:
  - Sales by region
  - Top-selling products
  - Monthly trends
